# Dr. Hengbin Wang: Effects of the RSFD1 UAB domain on gene expression change in ovarian cancer cells
## BRS-248


## Information about the dataset
### What species did the sample come from?
Human Cell lines
### How many samples? 
2 WT control, 2 treatment cell line samples (each one is two biological replicates from a single clone)
### What type of library (DNA, RNA, Protein, , etc?) 
RNAseq
### More specific, if applicable (Poly-A tail, miRNA, shRNA, etc?) 
Bulk poly-a mRNA
### Where is the data located? 
Novogene download link expired. Copied from /vcu_gpfs2/home/mccbnfotransfers/chenc17/ to /vcu_gpfs2/home/mccbnfolab/Christiane/wang_hengbin/wang_hengbin_rnaseq_0823/raw_data/
### What are you most interested in learning? 
Differential gene expression between the two groups, (Tx vs. Ctrl) GO analysis, Cancer Stem Cell Markers: Nanog, Oct4, CD117, CD44. 
### Additional requests
Lab would like aligned bam files, raw counts files, TMM normalized counts files.
